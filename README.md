# Hi, I'm Ponthep 👋

### Backend Developer | Node.js | Python | Next.js

I am a Senior Computer Engineering student at **Kasetsart University** specializing in building reliable backend systems and scalable web applications.

I focus on writing clean, production-ready code using modern frameworks like **NestJS** and **FastAPI**, with a strong emphasis on API performance and system reliability.

---

### 💻 Engineering Philosophy

* **Clean Code:** I write self-documenting code and prioritize **strong typing** and **static analysis** to prevent runtime errors before they happen.
* **End-to-End Ownership:** My experience as a sole backend developer has taught me to own the lifecycle—from interpreting business requirements to deployment.
* **AI-Native:** I leverage AI agents to accelerate development, acting as the architect while directing AI tools to handle implementation details.
